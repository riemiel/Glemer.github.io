            <p>Hello! My name is Glemer Rivera, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Elementary Education at Cebu Normal University. My academic journey has built a strong foundation in educational theories, including child psychology, curriculum development,
                and classroom management. I am passionate about using technology and innovative strategies to make learning more engaging. My hands-on experience through classroom observations and volunteer work has taught me the value of adaptability,
                patience, and creativity. Outside of academics, I enjoy crafting educational materials, teaching kids at church, and participating in community outreach programs. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated on educational
                trends. Thank you for exploring my e-portfolio. I hope it offers a glimpse into my journey, my goals, and my passion for making a meaningful contribution as an educator.</p>

                <h3>Fs 1</h3>
                <p>Field Study 1 (FS1) is a vital component of the Bachelor of Elementary Education program that provides students with practical classroom experiences. During FS1, students have the opportunity to observe experienced teachers in real classroom
                    settings, which helps them understand teaching strategies, classroom management, and teacher-student interactions. This experience allows students to reflect on their observations, analyze various teaching methods, and consider how
                    they can incorporate them into their own practice. FS1 also enables students to learn about the learning context, including the needs and behaviors of students, as well as how the curriculum is implemented. Although the focus is on
                    observation, student teachers may assist with minor tasks, such as helping with paperwork or other light activities. However, they are not allowed to teach. Ultimately, FS1 helps future educators develop essential skills and insights,
                    laying the foundation for their future teaching careers.</p>

            <h3>The Learners</h3>
            <p>During my field study, I had the wonderful opportunity to observe Grade 5 learners of Mrs. Hernandez. It was an enlightening experience that gave me a glimpse into their daily routines, behaviors, and unique personalities. From their boundless energy to their diverse traits, the time I spent with them offered a deeper appreciation of their strengths and the classroom dynamics.

                One notable personality they have in common is their enthusiasm; their energy was infectious, creating a lively and cheerful atmosphere in the classroom. Despite their playfulness, they remained respectful, always greeting us warmly whenever we entered the room, demonstrating a positive attitude toward visitors and authority figures. I also noticed how responsible they were, with daily routines that involved assigning roles for cleaning and managing snacks. These routines not only kept their environment organized but also instilled a sense of teamwork and accountability among the learners. Inclusivity was also evident in the classroom, as the class accommodated three Muslim students seamlessly within the group. This diversity highlighted the class's potential to foster understanding and respect for different backgrounds. Moreover, I noticed that every Friday, they wore different color-coded uniforms based on their grade level, which added a fun and unique touch to their week. It was a simple yet creative way to foster a sense of unity and identity within their grade.
                
                While there are many positive observations, there are also areas that could be improved. I observed that not all learners were equally engaged during lessons. While the girls were generally more active and participative, some of the boys—especially those seated at the back—appeared distracted and less interested. Moving them closer to the front might help them focus and be more involved. Another factor that seemed to affect their engagement was the lack of interactive teaching strategies. Incorporating more hands-on activities or group discussions could spark their interest and make learning more enjoyable.
                
                Overall, observing the Grade 5 learners was an insightful experience that showcased their unique strengths and behaviors. While there are areas that could be improved, such as engaging the boys and implementing interactive teaching strategies, the learners' curiosity, respectfulness, and enthusiasm make them promising individuals with great potential for growth and success in their educational journey.

            </div>
            <h3>The Teacher</h3>
            <p>During my field study, I had the opportunity to observe three experienced subject teachers every Friday morning. What immediately stood out was their ability to create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment. Each teacher made a conscious effort to engage every student in the lesson, ensuring that no one was left behind. Even the quieter students were given opportunities to contribute, making the classroom feel like a community rather than a space for one-sided lectures.

                A notable strength of the teachers was their time management skills. They were always punctual, starting and ending their lessons on time. This not only helped maintain a structured atmosphere but also allowed students to stay focused throughout the session. Despite the tight schedule, the teachers managed to cover all necessary points without rushing through the material. When disruptions occurred, they addressed them swiftly and effectively, maintaining the flow of the lesson without creating unnecessary tension in the classroom.
                
                The teachers’ awareness of student well-being was another admirable quality. They were attentive to any signs of bullying and didn’t hesitate to intervene if a student was being targeted. This focus on creating a safe and respectful learning environment was evident, and it was clear that they used their authority to ensure that students felt protected and valued.
                
                However, one aspect that stood out to me was their reliance on traditional teaching methods. While they did incorporate some technology, such as projecting a module on the screen, the majority of the teaching materials were conventional. This wasn’t necessarily a drawback, but I did wonder if more interactive digital tools could enhance the learning experience, making lessons more dynamic and engaging for the students.
                
                Overall, the teachers demonstrated a strong balance of experience, effective classroom management, and genuine care for their students. Their ability to create an inclusive learning environment where every student participates and feels valued stood out.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>The Learning Environment</h3>
            <p>During my observation at City Central School, I noted several positive aspects of the physical and tangible environment that contributed to a conducive learning atmosphere. The classroom was well-ventilated, making it comfortable for the students, especially since we were on the upper floor, and the temperature was not an issue. Additionally, the resources available for the learners were abundant; books were readily accessible, and each classroom had its own comfort room, ensuring convenience for the students.    

                The overall atmosphere of the environment was joyful and playful, which is expected in an elementary setting. The students appeared to be at ease, engaging with their lessons in a lively manner. I also observed that the classroom environment fostered inclusion, as students from various religious backgrounds were present. Respect and inclusivity were evident in the interactions among the students, contributing to a positive and supportive learning atmosphere.</p>

              <a href="# "><i class='bx bx-arrow-back'></i></a>
            </div>
            <h3>Instructional Materials </h3>
            <p>-The instructional materials used in the observed class are predominantly traditional, such as chalk and board, and paper and pen. Although there is minimal use of technology, teachers mainly rely on these traditional materials for teaching. The variety of instructional materials is limited, which may restrict the potential for engaging different learning styles. I noticed that the modules displayed on the screen included feedback opportunities, such as questions after each lesson, to check for understanding. However, these could be more engaging if structured as interactive activities.

                Additionally, the materials lack inclusivity, as some students were not actively listening or participating. In contrast, activities or group work tend to encourage more engagement and participation, as all students are involved whether they wish to be or not. On a positive note, the lessons featured real-life examples, which can help students make connections to the practical application of what they learn, making the lessons more relatable. Overall, there is still much room for improvement in the instructional materials to make them more inclusive and engaging.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>The Teaching-Learning Process</h3>
            <p>At City Central Elementary School, the teaching approach is mostly traditional, but it is effective in helping students learn. The teacher usually starts by reviewing the previous lesson before moving on to the new one, showing the module on the TV screen. While the lessons aren’t very interactive, the teacher makes sure students understand by asking questions and encouraging them to respond. This helps keep the students involved in the lesson, even though the teaching style is more focused on direct instruction.

                Although the lessons are teacher-centered, the teacher uses simple methods to ensure the students follow along and grasp the key points. The students still have a chance to participate by answering questions, which allows them to engage with the material and understand it better. The lesson is also properly concluded, with the teacher summarizing the key takeaways and ensuring the students have understood the concepts. The teacher’s effective classroom management, which is understandable given their experience, creates a smooth and organized learning environment.</p>

              <a href="# "><i class='bx bx-arrow-back'></i></a>
            </div>
            <h3>Assessing Students Learning</h3>
            <p>During my observation of the class, the teacher frequently asked questions to assess the students' understanding, which helped keep them engaged. This method worked well as it encouraged students to participate actively in the lesson. I also noticed that some students asked insightful questions, which is a good sign that they were truly processing and understanding the material. However, I observed that some students still struggled with certain concepts, particularly when the teacher introduced more abstract ideas. Despite these challenges, the students seemed to respond better when real-life examples were used. I could see their faces light up as they made connections between the lesson and their everyday experiences, which helped deepen their understanding.
                For example, when the teacher explained mathematical concepts using familiar scenarios like dividing a pizza or sharing treats, the students quickly grasped the idea. Though some had difficulty expressing their thoughts verbally, they followed instructions carefully and completed their tasks accurately. This showed that while verbalizing their understanding might have been challenging, the students were still able to apply the concepts effectively. One area I would have liked to observe more closely is how the students behaved during collaborative activities. I feel this would be an important area to focus on in the future, as it would provide insights into how well they work together and how collaborative skills can be further developed. Overall, it was clear that connecting lessons to real-life situations significantly aided the students' comprehension and made the learning experience more meaningful.

                <h3>My Reflection</h3>
                <p>Field Study 1 has opened my eyes to different possibilities in teaching. It has introduced me to challenges I didn't realize I could encounter and provided insights on how to handle them. By being in the actual field, this experience has
                    prepared me for what's to come. Observing two distinct school environments, the Integrated Laboratory School (ILS) and City Central Elementary School, has been incredibly valuable. At ILS, the use of technology and interactive lessons
                    demonstrated how engaging and dynamic a classroom can be. This showed me the potential of integrating modern tools and creative strategies to make learning more enjoyable and effective. On the other hand, City Central's traditional
                    methods highlighted the difficulties of keeping students engaged without such resources, especially with larger class sizes. Despite these challenges, the dedication and adaptability of the teachers at City Central were inspiring.
                    They found ways to make lessons meaningful, even with limited resources. This taught me the importance of flexibility and resourcefulness as a teacher. It reinforced the idea that effective teaching is not just about having the best
                    resources but about making the most of what you have and being committed to your students' success. This field study has shaped my journey towards becoming an educator by emphasizing the core principles of effective teaching: flexibility,
                    patience, and dedication. It has shown me that while teaching strategies may differ based on resources and environment, the commitment to creating an environment where all students can thrive remains the same. Moving forward, these
                    observations will be incredibly helpful. They have provided me with practical examples of how to engage students, manage classrooms, and adapt to different teaching environments. I now understand the importance of continuous professional
                    development and staying updated on the latest trends in education. As I develop my teaching philosophy, I will strive to incorporate the best practices I observed, aiming to create an engaging, supportive, and effective learning environment
                    for my future students. Field Study 1 has been an eye-opening experience that has prepared me for the realities of teaching. It has strengthened my passion for becoming an educator and given me the tools and insights needed to face
                    future challenges with confidence and creativity.</p>
